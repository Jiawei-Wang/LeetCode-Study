"""
understanding:
1. first always points to the smallest number in the whole array
2. second != inf means we already found a valid and smaller first
3. first may point to something else (for example: [1,0,2,0,-1,3] where first will eventually point to -1)
4. but as long as we have a valid second and have another number larger than second, we can return true
