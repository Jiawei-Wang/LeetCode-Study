"""
Based on Tech Interview Handbook:
https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/

Two things to consider:
1. what to do during exercise
2. what to do during interview



General approach:
1. understand the question 
    1) paraphrase and repeat the question 
    2) clarify assumptions: input format/input range/ambiguity/etc
    3) go through a simple example
2. identify DSA that can be used for this question
    1) give some DSA for this question 
    2) point out time/space complexity for all DSA
    3) talk about tradeoff
    4) agree on the most ideal approach and optimize it
    5) ask for permission before coding
3. coding
    1) explain why this syntax is used (show mastery of this language)
    2) ask for permission before using built in library 
4. checking
    1) check for syntax mistakes
    2) brainstorm edge cases and add test cases
    3) go through the code by hand: once again talk about DSA, time/space complexity, tradeoff
