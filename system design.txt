Step 0:
    get the question

Step 1: Scope
    1. identify use cases -> what functions are we going to design
    2. clarify the system's constraints -> Daily active users/Query per second/Storage
    3. provide data model
    4. provide api
    goal: gather the requirements and agree on the scope with no assumption

Step 2: Abstract
    1. break the system into important components 
    2. show connections between components
    3. justify ideas and address every constraint and use case
    goal: outline all important components with a simple high-level abstract design diagram 

Step 3: Bottleneck
    1. think about where are the bottlenecks, how to improve scalability (traffic/data)
    2. find solutions to solve bottlenecks 
    3. talk about trade-off for this solution
    goal: locate bottlenecks in the design, but not going into too much detail about solution

Step 4: Scalability -> main part
    1. dive into each component and provide details
    goal: make the system scalable
    
Step 5: Follow-up
