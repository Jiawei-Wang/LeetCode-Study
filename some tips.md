1. optimal solution uses all information in the question, for example if the question says the array is sorted, or values are unique, then the information must be used in the solution
2. use large and generic example first, then think about corner cases
3. start from brute force, optimize up
4. walk through solution before coding 
5. optimization tips:
   1. how to solve a given example with only pen and logic first (don't even think about algorithm)
   2. look for bottleneck, unnecessary work, duplicated work
   3. think about best conceivable runtime
6. syntax and logic are more important than perfect algorithm, avoid mistakes that give bad impression
